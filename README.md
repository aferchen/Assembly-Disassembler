# Assembly-Disassembler

In this repository, I have both projects I made for COMS 321, "Introduction to Computer Architecture and Machine-Level Programming". The first being "assignment1.legv8asm", is a version of Heapsort but implemented in Assembly. This project helped explore the Assembly language and served as a good first program in it. Including loops, conditions, and different types of variables.

The second project, "Dissasemble.java", is a Java made project to decode assembly code. Given binary LEGv8 instructions encoded in big-endian byte order, this project then converts this input into the original assembly code that would output the binary given. This project shows understanding of both the origional binary codes given to Assembly but also deeper knowlege of the language as a whole.

Languages used: Assembly & Java
